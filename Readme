	    Stephen Riehm's Bracketing macro system for Vim
	    ===============================================

(C)opyright: Stephen Riehm 1991

The directory tree contains macros for implementing Stephen Riehm's
bracketing system in vim. These macros should be useful for anyone who
writes a lot of code or normal text, where brackets and quotes appear
often.

            THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS!
            =====================================

Although I originally developed these macros in 1991 and have been using them
ever since, I have not spent much time turning them into a "product" which might
be of use to the masses.

This git repository is an attempt to correct that wrong!

If you have been using these macros and have suggestions for improvements with
regard to packaging, distribution, installation or improving the macros themselves,
please get in contact with me!
